### Study project (Java)

As a study project I implemented a BTree and compared with normal Java TreeSet on insertion, lookups and removals. It also implements `Set` interface from Java standard library including iterator. Some parts might not work as expected though: I didn't check for tree being changed while being iterated over for example.
